# ERP-System

- Front End:
The front end of the ERP system is developed using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This ensures a responsive and visually appealing user experience across different devices and screen sizes. Bootstrap provides a framework for creating consistent layouts and components, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript handle the structure, styling, and interactivity of the user interface.

- Back End:
PHP serves as the backbone of the ERP system, facilitating dynamic server-side processing and interaction with the database. PHP enables seamless communication between the front end and the database, allowing for efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and storage.

- Database:
MySQL is utilized as the database management system for storing and managing the organization's data. MySQL offers scalability, reliability, and performance, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data and supporting complex queries.

- Development Environment:
The implementation of the ERP system is carried out using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a lightweight and versatile code editor. VSCode provides a range of features and extensions that enhance productivity and facilitate collaborative development.

- Testing Environment:
XAMPP is employed as the local development environment for testing the ERP system before deployment. XAMPP combines Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl into a single platform, enabling developers to emulate a web server environment on their local machines. This allows for thorough testing and debugging of the system's functionality before it is deployed to a live server.

- Version Control:
GitHub is utilized for version control and efficient management of code changes. GitHub provides features such as version history, branching, and merging.
